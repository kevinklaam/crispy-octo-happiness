# Intro

An image repository built using HTML/CSS and PHP allows uses github repository for cloud storage of photos

HTML/CSS is used for website and styling
PHP is used to insert picture content into web page

A github repo is used to store all of the images, this was chosen as I would not have to worry about storage issues and it leverages GIT commits and authentication for image upload. Image storage -> https://github.com/kevinklaam/imagegallery

PHP is used to pull the image locations, github api GET request is used than JSON is parsed for image names and locations
